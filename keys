## Everything below requires OpenSSH 8.2 or higher! - Please don't use as your only activated keys if you dont have 8.2.
## Thankfully OpenSSH 8.2 is now well-spread, Debian 11 and Ubuntu 20.04 support it out of the box.
## So unless you're doing something weird it likely isn't an issue.

# FIDO/U2F Security key. Even more secure than Krypton.

# ^ Should be ignored if you don't have a supported OpenSSH version. 

# Akamai MFA! Basically Krypton but acquired by Akamai and somehow with worse UX, but probably more secure.
