            <p>
                Last I checked I was 23 years old and as it says above, I currently work at Cloudflare.<br>
                I spend a lot of my spare time messing about with pieces of technology and managing/moderating 
                online communities.<br>
                I have been known to play video games occasionally, but it has to be something special to
                hold my attention!
            </p>

            <p>
                I feel very passionate about helping people out where possible and doing small things to make other
                peoples lives easier and more fun! I usually try to achieve this through my software
                creations, which you can find on my GitHub profile!
            </p>

            <p>
                If you think I can help with anything, want me to join your project team or just want to say hi, please
                send me an email!<br>
                I welcome all friendly communication!
