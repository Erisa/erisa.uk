        <p>Hi there, I'm <span class="erisa">Erisa</span>!
            <br>I'm in Wales (UK!) and lately I dabble in software development.
        </br>If you want to check some of my stuff out then you can do that!

            Email: seriel@ this website domain. Technically speaking almost all addresses at that domain will work, but that's the one I use.
            You can also contact through "erisa" on evenfall.site for inquiries related to Project Evenfall.

            Note that the above is my *public* email, there is also gmail and hotmail addressses that are used for private or personal communication.
            I would greatly appreciate that should you know them, those addresses are reserved for personal matters rather than general inquiries.

            <p>If you're still reading that must mean you're really interested in me.<br>I'm flattered.</p>
            <p>Last I checked I was 21 years old and I currently work on personal hobby projects. My hobbies include
                breaking software (Mostly by doing the right thing the wrong way to see what happens) and reading
                fantasy novels.<br>I have been known to play video games occasionally, but it has to be ultra special to
                hold my attention!</p>
            <p>I feel very passionate about helping people out where possible and doing small things to make other
                peoples lives easier and more fun! I usually try to achieve this through my software and video game
                creations, which you can find on my GitHub profile!
            <p>If you think I can help with anything, want me to join your project team or just want to say hi, please
                send me an email!<br>I welcome all friendly communication!!</p>
