    	If you're still reading that must mean you're really interested in me.
    	I'm flattered.

    	Last I checked I was 23 years old, I currently work at Cloudflare in the Customer Support team and spend a lot of my spare time messing about with pieces of technology and managing/moderating online communities!<br/>
    	I have been known to play video games occasionally, but it has to be something special to hold my attention!<br/>

    	I feel very passionate about helping people out where possible and doing small things to make other peoples lives easier and more fun! I usually try to achieve this through my software creations, which you can find on my GitHub profile!

    	If you think I can help with anything, want to show me your project or just want to say hi, please send me an email!
    	I welcome all friendly communication!
