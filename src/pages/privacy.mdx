The vast majority of our web services will store limited access logs solely for the purpose of protecting against potential threats. These logs include IP address, the domain being visited and limited information about the path of the page being visited.  
This data is stored in a volatile form for a maximum of 3 days (72 hours) and is only ever looked at when a threat (DDoS, security exploit attempt, etc.) has been detected. The information in these log files will be automatically deleted and never knowingly shared with third parties.

Log file data (and the data for the websites themselves) is stored in Falkenstein, Germany. The host server is currently hosted at [Hetzner](https://hetzner.com/).

The web service [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) is utilised to prevent common threats against web properties. Cloudflare has their own [Privacy Policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/) and may store information about individuals that have triggered their security systems.
