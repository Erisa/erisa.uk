# erisa.uk

It's a website. You should go to [the website](https://erisa.uk) or view the source on this repo.  
That's it. Thanks.

## The website is now written in [Astro](https://astro.build/)??

Rough guide:

- `npm install` (grab deps)
- `npm run start` (astro dev server)
- `npm run dev` (cloudflare pages dev server)
- `npm run build` (build to `/dist`)
