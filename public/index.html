            <p>If you're still reading that must mean you're really interested in me.<br>I'm flattered.</p><p>Last I checked I was 20 years old and I currently work on personal hobby projects. My hobbies include breaking software (Mostly by doing the right thing the wrong way to see what happens) and reading fantasy novels.<br>I have been known to play video games occasionally, but it has to be ultra special to hold my attention!</p>
            <p>I feel very passionate about helping people out where possible and doing small things to make other peoples lives easier and more fun! I usually try to achieve this through my software and video game creations, which you can find on my GitHub profile!
                <p>If you think I can help with anything, want me to join your project team or just want to say hi, please send me an email!<br>I welcome all friendly communication!!</p>
