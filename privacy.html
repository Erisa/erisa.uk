        <p>The vast majority of our web services will store limited access logs solely for the purpose of protecting
            against potential threats. These logs include IP address, the domain being visited and limited information
            about the path of the page being visited.<br>
            This data is stored in a volatile form for a maximum of 3 days (72 hours) and is only ever looked at when a
            threat (DDoS, security exploit attempt, etc.) has been detected. The information in these log files will be
            automatically deleted and never knowingly shared with third parties.</p>
        <p>Log file data (and the data for the websites themselves) is stored in Falkenstein, Germany.
            The host server is hosted by <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/">Hetzner</a> on one of their
            dedicated servers.</a></p>
        <p>The web service <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> is utilised to prevent common threats
            against web properties. Cloudflare has their own <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/">Privacy
                Policy</a> and may store information about individuals that have triggered their security systems. Every
            effort is made to minimise the amount of personal data Cloudflare has access to.</p>
